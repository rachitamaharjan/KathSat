# KathSat
An Arduino-driven CanSat designed on a PCB containing environmental sensors like pressure, humidity, altitude, acceleration, gyroscope and wireless communication modules interfaced using SPI, UART, and I2C communications. The KathSat was dropped from 150 meters via octocopter and a robot equipped with a robotic arm retrieved it and carried it to the extraction zone.
